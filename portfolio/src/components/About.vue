        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Luke Holland, I graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in Software
            Engineering. I currently work at Barclays bank as a Software Engineering working with various technologies,
            mainly Java / Scala / Angular and various devops related services and technologies like AWS, OpenShift, Nexus
            and Jenkins.
            <br /><br />
            I'm passionate about devops and love automating tasks to streamline processes and improve efficiency. I enjoy
            the problem-solving aspects of programming, and thrive in collaborative environments where I can work with
            others to find creative solutions to complex challenges.
            <br /><br />
            In my free time, I like to create random projects, which you can check out in the projects section below. Some
            of my projects are hosted as single page applications which can be viewed by looking through my projects below
            the ones which are hosted and can be used have a link next to their name.
